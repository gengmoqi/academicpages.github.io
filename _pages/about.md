<!-- # Gengmo QI -->

*Phd Student in Computer Science*, Cornell University
<!--### **[Resume]()**-->

## Bio
I'm currently a Computer Science PhD student at Cornell University. My research interests broadly include security and privacy,Â distributed systems, and cryptoeconomics.

## Teaching
- Teaching Assistant:
	- CS 5112: Algorithms and Data Structures (Graduate level. 19 Fall, 20 Fall) 
		- with [Prof. Ramin Zabih](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdz/)
	- CS 5433: Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies, and Smart Contracts (Graduate level. 20 Spring)
		- with [Prof. Ari Juels](https://www.arijuels.com/)

## Professional Experience
* August 2019 - Present:
	* Teaching Assistant, **Cornell University**
	* Member of [IC3, The **I**nitiative For **C**rypto**C**urrencies & **C**ontracts](https://www.initc3.org/)
* August 2018 - August 2019:
	* Researcher, **[ThunderCore](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-02-28/thundercore-raises-50-million-in-funding-develops-protocol-enabling-lightning-fast-transactions-on-blockchain-platform)**
	* Consensus algorithms research. 	Advised by [Prof. Elaine Shi](http://elaineshi.com/)
	* I co-authored [*Consensus Protocols 101*](https://docs.thundercore.com/consensus-protocols-101.pdf), our attempt at an informal treatment of consensus protocols for developers, written in collaboration with [Peter Lu](https://twitter.com/_kitchen). This document collates (back then) what we believed were the most important facts to understanding blockchain consensus in an accessible way. 
		* Want a **formal and rigorous** treatment of consensus algorithms? I highly recommend [Foundations of Distributed Consensus and Blockchains](https://www.distributedconsensus.net/) by Prof. Elaine Shi.
		* For those unfamiliar with the term *consensus*, think of it as the problem of *getting a bunch of servers to agree on some messages*. You may think "Well that doesn't sound too difficult". However, like many other deeply fascinating problems in Computer Science, consensus is one of those easy-to-explain-but-hard-to-solve type of problems and have bugged multiple generations of Computer Scientists.
* June 2017 - August 2017:
	* Summer Analyst, **Credit Suisse**
	* Structured Funds, Equity Derivatives

## Talks and Presentations
* [Zerocash: Decentralized anonymous payments from Bitcoin](../files/Zerocash_Oakland14.pdf), November 2017
	* Paper presentation as part of COMP6111C: Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Technologies, taught by [Prof. Dimitris Papadopoulos](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~dipapado)

## Miscellanea
